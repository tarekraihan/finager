					<h3>Best Bank Account Interest Rates</h3>
					<h4><i>Asef Jamil, 02-Oct-2016</i></h4>
				</div><br/>
				<p>
					I’m seeing more signs that 2017 won’t be a repeat of 2016 in terms of the Fed. After the December rate hike of 2015, the Fed suggested in its dot plot that there would
					be four rate hikes in 2016. The only 2016 rate hike came two weeks ago at the last FOMC meeting of the year. At that meeting the Fed’s new dot plot suggests there’ll 
					be three rate hikes in 2017. Why should 2017 be any different? There are reasons to be optimistic even if you don’t factor in the potential positive changes from the 
					Trump administration. Economist Tim Duy describes why he thinks three rate hikes in 2017 is more likely than one in this post from his Fed Watch blog. Here’s a an
					excerpt of his “bottom line”:
				</p>
				<p>
					The economic situation on the ground is very different from December of last year. Whereas the decision to raise rates at that time looked ill-advised, this latest 
					action appears more appropriate given the likely medium-term path of the US economy. Assuming the US economy is near full employment, that path likely contains enough 
					upward pressure on activity to justify more than one more rate increase in 2017. Three I think is more likely than one.
				</p>
				<p>
					I slightly changed how I show the Fed Fund futures probabilities. I’m now showing the probabilities of both one and two rate hikes by three of next year’s Fed meetings.
					By the June meeting, the futures are showing about a 75% chance that there’ll be at least one rate hike and a 25% chance that there’ll be at least two rate hikes. 
					That’s up from 71% and 21% last week. By December, the futures show about a 77% chance that they’ll be at least two rate hikes, the same as last week.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most Treasury yields changed little from a week ago. The largest change was the 2-year yield which increased 3 basis points from last week.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following numbers are based on Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates and the CME Group FedWatch.<br/>
					<b>Treasury Yields:</b>
					<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
						<li>1-month: 0.50% up from 0.48% last week</li>
						<li>6-month: 0.66% same as last week</li>
						<li>2--year: 1.28% up from 1.25% last week</li>
						<li>5--year: 2.07% up from 2.06% last week</li>
						<li>10-year: 2.57% same as last week</li>
						<li>30-year: 3.14% down from 3.15% last week</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Fed funds futures' probabilities of future rate hikes by:</b><br/>
					<ul style="margin-left:15px;">
						<li>Mar 2017 - at least one hike: 25.3% down from 34.5% last week</li>
						<li>Mar 2017 - at least two hikes: 0.9% down from 4.2% last week</li>
						<li>Jun 2017 - at least one hike: 75.2% up from 70.8% last week</li>
						<li>June 2017 - at least two hikes: 24.9% up from 21.0% last week</li>
						<li>Dec 2017 - at least one hike: 95.8% down from 95.9% last week</li>
						<li>Dec 2017 - at least two hikes: 77.0% same as last week</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><b>Savings & Checking Account Rates</b></h4>
				<p>
					Banks and credit unions appear to have taken off for the holidays. All of the top nationally available savings and money market accounts listed below had no rate 
					changes from last week. After the holidays, we will see if the latest Fed rate hike will impact any of these accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The number of accounts in the 1% club remains at 21. The 1% club is the group of nationally available checking, savings and money market accounts that have rates of
					at least 1% APY. I exclude accounts that have promotional rates that are scheduled to fall after a certain amount of time. Also, I exclude accounts in which the 1%+ 
					rate is available only for new customers. The ones on the promotional category include EverBank, The Palladian PrivateBank, Northeast Bank, iGObanking.com’s MMA and 
					Salem Five Direct.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><b>Reward Checking Accounts</b></h4>
				<p>
					Banks and credit unions are also in a holding pattern with their reward checking accounts. There were no changes in the nationally available reward checking list.
				</p>
				<p>
					To find the highest reward checking rates and balance caps in your state or nationwide, please refer to our reward checking rate table. If you're new to reward 
					checking, please refer to my blog post, Overview of Reward Checking & Our Reward Checking Table.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<h4><b>Certificate of Deposit Rates</b></h4>
				<p>
					I’m now publishing my CD survey as a separate post. Please refer to my survey of the best CD rates. This recap will focus on banking news of the week and liquid accounts.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Hot CD Deals:</b> I just wanted to include this reminder of Navy Federal’s special 17-month CD. Two things make this a hot deal: a 2.00% APY and an add-on feature that 
					allows any number of additional deposits. The one caveat is that there’s a maximum balance of $50,000. If you’re not already a Navy Fed member, there’s a good chance 
					you can join. Please refer to this blog post for more details.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, don’t forget time is running out for the other hot CD deal. Andrews Federal Credit Union’s 3.04% 7-year CD and its other promotional CDs are scheduled to end on December 31st.
