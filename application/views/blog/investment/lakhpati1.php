					are fixed for a short period of time i.e. less than one year. Long-term fixed deposits are those term deposits where the term-to-maturity and interest rate are fixed 
					for a long period of time i.e. one year or more. The interest rates on fixed deposits are revised over time in accordance to market changes and bank requirements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fixed deposits are gaining ground as an investment avenue in 2014 given the government's positive outlook on controlling inflation. Lower inflation makes fixed return
					products like fixed deposits more attractive as the returns are guaranteed and not diminished by inflation.

					yearly/half-yearly/quarterly/monthly as per the selected deposit scheme. The rates are directly affected by policy reviews done by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)

					BankBazaar.com is one such site that provides information not only on the fixed deposit rates in Central Bank of India but also lets you calculate the maturity values 
					of the deposits by using a deposit rate calculator. Using this, the maturity value of the fixed deposit is returned on inputting the deposit amount for a particular 
					tenure at a particular rate. You can also then apply for the product that suits you the best. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Fixed deposit rates are different across banks because there are many factors that affect the rates set by each bank. Some key factors are: liquidity requirements, 
					change in RBI's policy, profitability and also to build customer base and compete. These are some of the reasons why other banks may offer fixed deposits at more
					attractive rates but the features of the products have to be compared to best suit one's investing requirements.
