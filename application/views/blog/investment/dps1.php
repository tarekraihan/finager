					<h3>DEPOSIT DISPUTES REACH RECORD HIGH</h3>
					<h4><i>Asef Jamil, 02-Oct-2016</i></h4>
				</div><br/>
				<p>
					According to the Deposit Protection Scheme (DPS) quarterly statistics, the national average of a tenancy deposit in Q2 when renting a home in England and Wales
					was £970.48 – an increase of 4.47% on Q1 2016.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					The costs of moving into a rental property are increasingly on the rise despite campaigns from charity organisations such as Shelter in a bid to cut agent fees to 
					tenants – some charging over £1000 in administrations fees.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					It’s no surprise then that number of tenancy deposit disputes has reached a record high in 2015-16 according to figures from the Department for Communities and Local 
					Government (DCLG). They show that in the year to March 2016, the three deposit schemes in England and Wales resolved 28,100 disputes, the highest annual number ever 
					recorded.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					Since the protection of tenancy deposits became mandatory in 2007, landlords have had the legal responsibility to register their tenant’s deposit with one of the
					deposit schemes on a custodial or insured basis.
				</p><br/>
				<p>
					We believe this requirement encourages best practice in the industry and motivates both parties to fulfil their obligations under the terms of the tenancy such as
					leaving the property in the condition it was in at the start of the agreement, which can be clearly demonstrated by providing a comprehensive inventory.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Under LettingaProperty.com’s Gold and Platinum rent management services, we’ve registered near on £1 million in tenancy deposits on behalf of our clients, with an 
					average deposit of £1581 and an average monthly rental of £1212 which represents approximately 5.6 weeks deposit for a typical tenancy.
				</p>
				<p>
					We encourage our landlords to seek a deposit equivalent to around 6 weeks rent. This helps in cases where rent is owed and in addition, there is damage to the property.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					When it comes to disputes, the Tenancy Dispute Service (TDS) reports that tenants get back the entirety of the disputed deposit in around 17% of cases, while landlords 
					win all of the money in 21% of disputes. It says payments are allocated to both parties in 61% of cases. 
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p>
					Overall, in 2015-16, the average deposit disputed with TDS was £863.40, with 45.5% being returned to tenants and the remaining 54.5% going to landlords and letting 
					agents. Damage to fixtures and fittings features in 51% of claims, followed by redecoration (32%), rent arrears (19%) and gardening (16%).
