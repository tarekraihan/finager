					<h3>Six Reasons to Get a Personal Loan</h3>
					<h4><i>Asef Jamil, 02-Oct-2016</i></h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					While it would be great if we all had enough money to fund all of life’s expenses without worry,
					we know that’s not the case. Sometimes we have to borrow a little to keep moving forward, and that’s when a personal loan can be a good solution.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>What is a personal loan?</h4>
					A personal loan is a type of loan that involves borrowing a set amount of money and paying the creditor off with interest
					in a structured payoff schedule. These loans are “unsecured” because you don’t have to put up any collateral 
					(such as your house, car, etc.) to get the loan; instead, lenders use your personal credit and other factors to
					determine eligibility. The concept is simple and similar to the borrowing you’re used to: you borrow and pay that money back.
					One of the benefits is that you have more flexibility with what you can use the money for. 
				</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>
					<h4><b>Here are 6 situations where a personal loan can help:</b></h4>
					<b>1 . Debt consolidation</b> <br><br>
					Having different amounts of debt with various creditors can be difficult to handle. Each debt will have its own interest rate, 
					monthly payment, and due date. For these reasons among others, borrowers can sometimes find themselves lost in their debts,
					resulting in missing payments, paying more interest over time due to higher interest rates, and having another thing to worry about.
					By taking out a personal loan, you can use that money to pay off your various creditors and be left with just one single monthly payment to make. 
					Consolidation can save you time and money and is one the best benefits a personal loan can offer. 
					If you’re curious how much you could potentially be saving, check out our personal loan calculator.

					<b>2 . Credit card payoff</b> <br><br>
					Having different amounts of debt with various creditors can be difficult to handle. Each debt will have its own interest rate, 
					monthly payment, and due date. For these reasons among others, borrowers can sometimes find themselves lost in their debts,
					resulting in missing payments, paying more interest over time due to higher interest rates, and having another thing to worry about.

					<h4>3. Home improvement</h4>
					The Enhanced Business Platinum Card from American Express OPEN, a GET.com advertiser, 
					offers 100,000 points after you spend $15,000 in the first three months. This limited 
					time offer is valid only until January 25, 2017. If you can't meet those requirements,
					you can still get 50,000 points after spending $5,000 within the first three months of account opening.   
				</p> 
				<p>
					<h4>4. Home improvement</h4>
					Looking to make some home improvements but don’t want to dip into your savings or take out a home equity loan? 
					Personal loans can be a perfect solution for a home improvement project. There is no equity required to qualify 
					for a personal loan, and you can apply from the comfort of your own home and receive your funds in as little as a week.
					Taking out a personal loan to make those bathroom renovations, upgrade your kitchen, or add a pool or spa to your backyard can be a great option.   
				</p> 
				<p>
					<h4>5. Medical expenses </h4>
					Alright, this isn’t an ideal scenario: you’re sick, need to undergo a procedure but realize you don’t quite have the money 
					available to pay for it. This is a situation where taking out a personal loan can prove beneficial, since you can borrow 
					what you need and select a payoff structure that works with your budget. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>6. Major purchase</h4>
					Whether you’re making a larger purchase that you’ve deemed necessary or you’re trying to figure out how to pay for a new 
					refrigerator because yours suddenly stopped working, or your latest car issue seems like it’s going to be an expensive one to fix, 
					a personal loan can be a good consideration. Get the money that you need and pay off the balance over a longer period of time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>7. Vacation</h4>
					We all need a break from time to time but we know that a vacation can cost a little more than we’d like to spend at any one time. 
					A personal loan can be a good way to finance your vacation, so that you can pay it off over time. And hey, 
					it could be a good monthly reminder of just how much fun you had.
				</p>
				<p>
					With free access to your FICO score and a $0 intro annual fee for the first year, then $89,
					this should be a popular card. Read our Barclaycard Arrival Plus™ World Elite MasterCard® review to learn more about the credit card. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>5. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card</h4>
					Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is another travel credit card that doesn't 
					charge a foreign transaction fee. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card offers 40,000 bonus 
					miles for new cardmembers after they've spent $3,000 in the first three months of account opening.
					How much is 40,000 bonus miles worth? It is worth $400 in the form of statement credits when used for travel.
				</p>

					dollar spent on every purchase, every day. This card has a $0 intro annual fee for the first year; $59 after that.

				<p>

					Some people find it difficult to meet the minimum spending requirements. 
					If this sounds like you, Blue Cash Preferred Card from American Express is a good choice. 
					Cardholders will get a $150 bonus in the form of statement credit when they've spent $1,000 within the first three months of account opening.
