					<h3>CELEBRATE YOUR MILESTONE WITH A PREPAID DEBIT CARD</h3>
					<h4><i>Akter ul alam, 02-Oct-2016</i></h4>
				</div>
				<br/>
				<p>
					College is a new frontier, teeming with possibilities – studies, fun and a new found freedom. However, college life needs to be taken seriously 
					because the mistakes you make now can follow you throughout the rest of your life. This is why it is important to manage your finances and not 
					let it lead to worry, debt and increasing financial difficulties in the future. College expenses can include tuition fees, rent, books, equipment, 
					classroom supplies, food, social and recreation expenses, transportation, personal expenses, health care, phone bill etc. How you handle your money
					will be greatly affected by what method you use to access your cash. Today we have several financial lifestyle products that not only help you manage
					money smartly, but also provide an alternative to the traditional banking methods. A prepaid debit card is a safer and easier alternative to traditional
					banking for college students. It helps you have more control over your spending.
				</p><br/>
				<h4><b>Budget your College expenses with a Prepaid Debit Card</b></h4>
				<p>
					Budgeting is rather difficult. You may use up your monthly allowance and find out there is nothing left because you didn’t keep track of your spending. 
					If you depend on a credit card, you may end up spending more than you intend to, resulting in a huge debt. By using prepaid debit card you can form a budget
					that is both flexible and realistic.
				</p><br/>
				<h4><b>Track your Spending</b></h4>
				<p>
					With prepaid debit cards like Elite Member Card {www.elitemembercard.com}, you can keep track of your spending as you are updated through free text and email alerts each time you use your card. You can also know exactly how much you have on your card. If you feel you need more money in case of an emergency, it is easy for your parent or a guardian to load money into your card at over 60,000 locations across USA {www.elitemembercard.com/StoreLocator.aspx}.
					There are no repayments to be made since prepaid cards use the deposited money. This means no late payment fees and other associated penalties. Click Here to find out about the Elite Member Card’s fee structure.

				</p>
				<p>
					Prepaid debit cards represent the fastest-growing noncash payments in America, according to a Federal Reserve Payments Study in 2010. It helps you to avoid the 
					credit card-related fee as well as the bank-related fee. There are no interest rates, no activation fees, no overdraft fees or a requirement to maintain a minimum balance.
				</p><br/>
				<h4><b>Direct Deposit</b></h4>
				<p>
					Students usually take up part-time jobs while in college. This is not only a great way to save up money but also a good chance to build your resume,
					gain experience and create valuable connections. However, cashing your pay checks using check cashing services can be costly and not feasible while 
					simultaneously handling the expenses of your college life. According to Claes Bell, award-winning reporter for Bankrate.com, an average check cashing
					service costs about 3 percent of the check amount! By enrolling in direct deposit you can save on check cashing fees. Elite Member Prepaid Visa Card 
					offers free enrollment for direct deposit. Have your pay direct deposited to your card for free and save more than $700 a year. You can also have your
					monthly fees waived. Click Here to learn more.
				</p><br/>
				<h4><b>Easier Than Cash</b></h4>
				<p>
					Prepaid cards have entered the mainstream. According to Madeline Aufseeser, a senior analyst at Aité Group, retail purchases in the U.S.
					made with prepaid cards will top $200 billion dollars in 2014. This is equal to five percent of all retail spending in the U.S.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you have poor credit and can’t get a credit card, getting a prepaid card is a good way to make purchases online. It is easy to acquire 
					a prepaid debit card and you don’t require a credit check. You can register for an Elite Member Prepaid Visa Card online by submitting your
					personal details. We will do an ID verification and as long as we can validate your identity and social security number you are entitled to
					get a card. Once verified, a card will be sent to you and you simply have to activate it, load money and start using it. Click Here to get
					your Elite Member Prepaid Visa Card.
				</p>
				<p>
					With the rise of new fees and higher minimum balance requirement on traditional checking accounts, the prepaid cards are becoming more preferable
					because of its convenience, ubiquity of acceptance, immediate access to funds and account information.  Prepaid cards are also attractive due to 
					their simplicity, transparency of fees, cost effectiveness relative to the available alternatives, and built-in discipline due to the inability to overdraw.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prepaid credit cards can be used to get instant cash from almost all the ATM’s and the transaction is very secure. You can make purchases,
					pay bills and manage your money without the need for a checking account or credit history. Have a great time in college and we hope you leave with no regrets.
