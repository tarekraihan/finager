					<h3>6 Best Credit Card Bonuses Available Today</h3>
					<h4><i>Akter ul alam, 02-Oct-2016</i></h4>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>
					<h4>1. Chase Sapphire Reserves</h4>
					<span class="uper_text">C</span>hase currently offers new Chase Sapphire Reserves cardholders a bonus of 100,000 points 
					when they spend $4,000 within the first three months. By using the Chase Ultimate Rewards Portal towards travel purchases, 
					cardholders can get $1,500 value out of the points. 
				</p>
				<p>
					With 3x points that you can earn on restaurants and travel purchases worldwide, along with 1x rewards on everything else, 
					rewards will surely add up. The only bad news is that it comes with a $450 annual fee, though a $300 statement credit essentially lowers it to $150. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Anyone not wanting to pay the annual fee can sign up for Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card instead. 
					The spending rules are the same, but the card still offers a formidable 50,000 bonus points.
					Read our Chase Sapphire Reserves review to learn more about the card. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>2. Discover it® Cashback Match</h4>
